## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a dual student at Hitachi Rail, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Embedded Systems. I will graduate in September 2025. My main focus is on electrical engineering topics, but in my free time I also work on various software-related projects, which I share here.
My interests center around automating everyday processes and developing integrations for Home Assistant. I often work with microcontrollers to automate tasks and make daily life easier.

At the moment, I'm working on my bachelor thesis, so I'm not very active. However, I look forward to dedicating more time to personal projects in the future.
